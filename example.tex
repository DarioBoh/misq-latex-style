\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we do some clever things with data. For example, we construct
a large relational database~\citep{codd1970relational} to collect a large
amount of data. In order to communicate the structure of this database, we
use an Entity-Relationship diagram~\citep{chen1976entity}. We then analyze
this data and learn great things about how to improve the world using information systems.
